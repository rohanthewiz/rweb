# Intro
This is an example server that can be used as a proxy server for the `hello` example project

## TODO
- Update to the latest rweb `go get -u github.com/rohanthewiz/rweb@master`
- If a route is not working with the proxy, try to properly match those up. We will try to keep both examples matched.
